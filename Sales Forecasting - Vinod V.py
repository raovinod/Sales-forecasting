# Explanation of Features:
# 1. Temporal Features:
#    - day: Extracts the day of the month to identify intra-month sales patterns.
#    - week: Captures weekly sales cycles, which are useful for promotions and trends.
#    - month: Helps capture seasonal trends and holiday effects.
#    - year: Useful for differentiating between long-term trends and yearly variations.
#    - weekday: Identifies the impact of weekends and weekdays on sales.

# 2. Holiday and Event-based Features:
#    - is_holiday: Flags whether a date is a holiday, as holidays affect store traffic.
#    - is_payday: Marks payday (15th or month-end) when people tend to spend more.
#    - earthquake_impact: Identifies sales impact due to the 2016 earthquake.

# 3. External Economic Indicator:
#    - dcoilwtico: Tracks oil prices, which can influence inflation and consumer spending.

# 4. Historical Sales Features:
#    - sales_7d_avg: 7-day moving average to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
#    - sales_30d_avg: 30-day moving average to capture long-term trends.
#    - sales_lag_7d: Sales from 7 days ago to account for weekly patterns.
#    - sales_lag_30d: Sales from 30 days ago to capture monthly shopping trends.

# Model Performance Summary and Business Insights

## **1. Best Performing Model**
Based on the evaluation metrics (RMSE and MAPE), the best-performing model was **RandomForestRegressor**.  
- It had the lowest **RMSE =224.64, MAPE = 484290623118327872.00% ** .
- Random Forest performed better than ARIMA and XGBoost because it effectively captured both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
- ARIMA struggled with non-linearity in sales data, and XGBoost, while competitive, was slightly less accurate than Random Forest.

## **2. Impact of External Factors**
Several external factors influenced the model's predictions:
- **Holidays:** Sales spiked during major holidays, showing increased demand due to promotions and festive shopping.
- **Oil Prices:** Fluctuations in oil prices indirectly affected sales, as they impact transportation costs and overall consumer spending.
- **Payday Effects:** Sales increased around the 15th and month-end, suggesting that customers tend to shop more after receiving their salaries.
- **Earthquake Event (April 16, 2016):** A significant drop in sales was observed due to disruptions in supply chains and consumer activity.

## **3. Business Strategies for Better Sales Forecasting**
To improve future sales predictions and optimize business operations, the following strategies can be implemented:
- **Inventory Optimization:** Stock levels should be adjusted based on forecasted demand to prevent overstocking or stockouts.
- **Targeted Promotions:** Discounts and special offers should be strategically placed around payday and holidays to maximize revenue.
- **Incorporate More Data Sources:** Weather data, competitor pricing, and macroeconomic indicators can enhance forecast accuracy.
- **Real-time Forecasting:** Implementing an automated real-time forecasting system will allow for quick adjustments in pricing and inventory.

By leveraging these insights, businesses can improve demand planning, reduce costs, and increase profitability.
